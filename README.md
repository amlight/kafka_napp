# Overview

This NApp integrates Kafka with the Kytos SDN platform to enable event-driven messaging and real-time event streaming.

# Features

- Asynchronous Kafka producer with support for compression and acknowledgments.
- Automatic Kafka topic creation if it does not exist.
- Event listener for new switch connections, publishing events to Kafka.
- Resilient Kafka admin client with automatic retries for connectivity issues.
- Threaded asyncio loop to handle asynchronous tasks without blocking Kytos.
- Graceful shutdown ensuring Kafka producer cleanup and event loop termination.
